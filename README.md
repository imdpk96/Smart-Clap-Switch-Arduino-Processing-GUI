# 🔊 Smart Clap Switch using Arduino UNO + Processing GUI 💡

Control your bulb with just two claps — and see its status in a custom desktop GUI!  
This DIY **home automation project** is perfect for beginners using **Arduino UNO**, a **sound sensor**, and a **relay module**. Plus, it's visualized beautifully in **Processing** using real-time Serial communication.


## 🎯 Features

- 👏 **Double Clap Detection** – Two claps = Bulb ON, next two claps = Bulb OFF
- 🖥️ **Real-time GUI** in Processing – See bulb status visually (ON/OFF)
- 📡 **Serial Communication** – Arduino sends status to PC GUI
- 🧠 **Debouncing + Clap Window Logic** – Accurate, reliable triggering
- ⚡ Easy to build with beginner-friendly components

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Arduino Side:
- Listens to sound sensor (D0 pin)
- If 2 claps are detected within 1 second ➜ toggles relay ON/OFF
- Sends status via Serial: `"Bulb ON"` / `"Bulb OFF"`

### Processing GUI:
- Listens to Arduino Serial output
- Shows bulb as **yellow glowing** when ON and **gray dim** when OFF
- Displays `"Bulb is ON"` / `"Bulb is OFF"` as text

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Upload the `ClapSwitch_DoubleClap.ino` code to your Arduino UNO.
2. Open `ClapBulb_GUI.pde` in Processing IDE.
3. Run the GUI (choose correct serial port).
4. Clap **twice** to turn the bulb **ON**, clap **twice** again to turn it **OFF**.
5. Watch the GUI update in real-time!
